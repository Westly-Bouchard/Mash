# This is Mash!

Mash is a small interpreted programming language I designed and wrote as a final project for a computer science class.

# Build and Run
Mash utilizes only C++ standard libraries, so no need to worry about installing anything. Simply clone this repo, run `make` (assuming you have g++ installed), and start coding!

## Examples
Some example mash scripts are provided in the `examples` directory, check them out to see some of the different things that mash can do.
